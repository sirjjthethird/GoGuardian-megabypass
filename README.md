So, I found a way to bypass goguardian and filters. Essentially, you need to get to any application (outside of chrome) which you can log into microsoft. If you can find any apps that can be signed in with microsoft, DM nitroshaft#0874 and request collaborator with a list of different applications you have found with details.

Testnav: Student portal, sign in with whatever is at the bottom and quickly shut your computer. Open it up, click status page, click developers, then developer site. You will see a whole bunch of options at the bottom without scrolling down. Click client SDKs, and click github. Then search google, see topic, and the google link at the side of the topic page.
